    Few words about my bicycle.

    It is an e-bike. That means it has an electric motor and the battery. The motor supports me when I’m pedaling but it stops when I stop, or when I go faster than 25km/h. It has hydraulic disc brakes, belt (instead of a chain) and automatic gearbox. I won’t write about brakes, because they work as they should. There is no difference between a belt and a chain on a normal bike ride. Belt is lighter, but that doesn’t matter in an e-bike (which is of course heavy). It is promissed that there’s much less maintenance needed with a belt and that is the reason, why I wanted it.

    Automatic, stepless shifting hub (“gear box”) is worth few words. Couple of months ago I had a chance to try stepless shifting hub for the first time and from the beginning I really liked it. I was looking for a bicycle with it, but in current situation in the market, it was very difficult to find. Stepless “gearbox” means there are no gears. Changing the “gear ratio” is completly fluent. In addition, in this bicycle the ratio changes automatically. On the bike computer, I set the cadence I want to pedal with. The computer sets the gear for comfortable ride. To be honest, I think it is the most useless feature of this bicycle. Changing gears manually in hub gearboxes is super easy and intuitive. The computer sets it in some way, but it’s often not the way I want it. Only when I ride in constant speed, the cadence is set the way I programmed. I don’t really know what is the problem, that engineers wanted to resolve with this automation. The only situation, when I could imagine it usefull, would be riding with something in my right hand and not being able to switch manually (what happens, but is very rare). On the other hand, since I’m just a leisure biker, it does not disturb me.

    The bicycle, typical for dutch bicycles, is very practical in daily use. It has a bicycle rack which can handle 27kg, so I can carry even bigger groceries. Wide tyres allow to easily ride even on the ground paths. The position on the bicycle is straigth and comfortable.

    The electric motor is promised to be more powerful than standard. I was using another e-bike with standard front wheel motor, technically less powerfull, but practically, I do not experience a difference.

    In summary, I enjoy riding it very much. As a result, I made 50km ride on the first day, and 30km ride on the second day. The standard battery (400Wh) was still about half charged after 30km ride, on very windy day.
